Commerce websites often record visits to analyze customer behavior. One important aspect of customer analytics is whether a visit to the website results in a sale. An e-commerce agent might analyze how long visitors stay on the website, how many pages they visit, what types of pages they visit, and whether they make a purchase. Such information can be used to predict whether a visit will result in a purchase.
